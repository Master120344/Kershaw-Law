                            <p>These visas allow U.S. employers to hire foreign nationals for temporary jobs. The <strong>H-2A visa</strong> is for temporary or seasonal agricultural work. The <strong>H-2B visa</strong> is for temporary non-agricultural work (e.g., landscaping, construction, hospitality). Both programs require employers to demonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available for the temporary work.</p>

                            <p>U.S. employers or agricultural associations who anticipate a shortage of domestic workers for temporary agricultural jobs can petition for H-2A workers. Key requirements include:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>The H-2B visa is for temporary non-agricultural jobs. Employers must prove a temporary need (a one-time occurrence, seasonal need, or peak-load need) and that U.S. workers are not available. A significant factor for H-2B is the <strong>statutory annual cap</strong> set by Congress, which is often supplemented but still highly competitive. Demand consistently exceeds the cap, often leading to a lottery. Timely and accurate filing is critical.</p>

                            <p>Starting early is crucial. General timelines are:</p>
                            <p><strong>For H-2A visas:</strong> Employers should ideally begin the process at least <strong>75 days (but no fewer than 60 days)</strong> before the workers' intended start date. More lead time is always better.</p>
                            <p><strong>For H-2B visas:</strong> Due to the cap, employers should start preparations **6 to 9 months** before the employment start date to plan around cap subjection periods.</p>
                            <p>Key steps in both processes typically include filing with the Department of Labor (DOL), conducting U.S. worker recruitment, and then filing a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Our firm manages each step to ensure an efficient and compliant process.</p>

                                 <li><strong>Government Filing Fees:</strong> Fees payable to USCIS for the I-129 petition and other related costs. Employers should always check the current USCIS fee schedule.</li>

                             <p>The initial period of stay granted to an H-2 worker matches the employer's certified temporary need, usually up to one year. Extensions are possible in increments, allowing a worker to remain in H-2 status for a maximum continuous period of up to <strong>3 years</strong>. After reaching the 3-year maximum, workers must depart the U.S. for an uninterrupted period before being eligible to return under H-2 status.</p>
